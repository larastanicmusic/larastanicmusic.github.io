    <p>Close Distance is a web audio live-electronics piece for open microphones. The listeners are invited to participate in the sound design of the piece from their electronic device via an open microphone. 
      As a listener, you can, for example, say something or sing into your cell phone, tablet or computer microphone, scratch, knock on it - no matter what. 
      These inputs are processed. On the one hand, you hear the input itself, delayed, and on the other, its electronic processing. 
      There may also be feedback, you can take part in the piece with or without headphones.
      Nothing sounds by itself. There is no fundamental tone or something similar that would then be modeled by the audience afterwards. 
      Everything you hear comes straight from the microphone inputs. There are no prepared sounds. The piece arises from the activity of the audience. 
      The inputs of the listeners do not serve as a sensor or something similar to generate other sounds. You hear what you enter. The software rhythmicizes and structures the inputs. 
      The inputs are processed in three ways: First, they are repeated. Second, they are reverberated. Third, there is a panorama effect, which means that the sounds can be heard in the left or right ear. 
      In addition to this sound processing, the sounds are truncated. Just like a window structures incoming noise - depending on whether it is open or closed. This creates rhythms of different speeds.

The idea of a room with many windows serves as inspiration for the piece. The movement of the air causes the individual shutters to open and close. 
The sounds and noises penetrate the room in different tempos, volume levels and lengths and create playful rhythmic structures. A web browser provides the virtual space for the piece.
